**2021-01-07 Meeting Minutes for the**

**Public Cloud z/OS Enablement working group**

**Attendees:**
Kip Twitchell
Len Santalucia
John Mertic
Sandy Peresie
Alex Kim
Dave Edelsohn
Hiran Shah
Randall Ness

Kip began by proposing a problem statement, sample dimensions, and initiative tagline for the group:

**Suggested Problem Statement:**

    Lack of access to z environments is a major impediment to the growth and innovation on the platform. Type of uses targeted include:
        - Open Source Communities and new software development efforts
        - Mentoring and new user growth, consistent with and attractive to those who use other public cloud learning opportunities
        - Experimentation and innovation on the edge of environment stability like the Raspberry Pi Model
    Impediments to these types of environments include:
        - Critical knowledge and support in sysprogs for z systems
        - Cost and control of donated resources (MIPs, software, storage, etc.)
        - Security and access control
    This project intends to create code, processes and techniques which reduce these impediments and enable broader use and development of the z platform

**Sample Dimensions**

    Tenancy:  Multi-tenant vs. Single-tenant
    Operation:  Emulated vs. Bare Metal
    Hardware:  Donated Hardware vs. Owned Hardware
    OS:  Operating system Choices (zVM, zLinux, z/OS, etc.)
    Emulator: (zD&amp;T, zPDT, zVM, Docker, Vagrant, other)
    User Organization Type: (community, single company, multi company, other)
    Sysprog support model: (shared vs. independent)

**Proposed Initiative Tagline:** Public Z Cloud Enablement


Matt Hogstrom wasn&#39;t able to attend the meeting, but he offered this comment on the problem statement beforehand:

I would be specific on the environments as being IBM z/OS Instances.   z environments is ambiguous and could lead to questions about z/VM, VSE, TPF, zLinux Instances, â€¦ if those are all in scope them IBM Z guest environments might be a better term.   I think tactically we&#39;ve been discussing z/OS environments.

Here is a loose transcript of the ensuing discussion:

Kip
we have two communication points:
slack channel
mailing list
suggested problem statement
Matt thought we should focus on z/OS

Randall
Linux users have other options

Len
LinuxOne Cloud is a resource
issue is to make an open-to-the-world z/OS platform
Virginia Commonwealth Univesity (VCM) is trying to come up with funding for a mainframe
would be used for their students and for OMP
dragging out because of CSci and School of Medicine

Kip
how can we lower the barriers for your support team?
Marist University is also offering support
if we made the cost and work effort low enough, IBM could host

Dave
two other dimension uses
interactive
github
Travis CI
continuous integration testing
not necessarily batch

Hiran
any thoughts on having commonly used services in public cloud?
for use in public cloud manner

Kip
use as a data platform

Alex
at the last meeting, we discussed gauging the development needs
could be result of survey

Kip
for the next meeting, we should build a model for the intersection of these dimensions
would give us a way to think about tasks
some dimensions would require a survey, others not
how we attack them

Alex
I don&#39;t think Docker and Vagrant are emulators

Kip
I&#39;ll remove
on sysprog support model, s/b
shared, independent, and semi-independent

Hiran
another dimension s/b charged/free

Alex
good

Sandy
emulator?

Hiran
does &quot;z hardware&quot; cover IBM Z?

Alex
no reason for separate dimensions for emulator

Kip
I think batch is an old term, but it means &quot;analytical processes&quot;
within the transaction processing system
creates reconciliation issues, transfer issues

Dave
one use case is having the system available for system development
separate aspect is for people to actually understand how to run on z/OS
difference between a user of software and developer of software
might want to spell this out
do we want this to be a compute cluster?
I&#39;m very much involved with the Gnu compile farm
and LinuxONE cloud
maybe there is some computationally intensive software
not a substitute for AWS
this service isn&#39;t for free cycles

Hiran
you cannot run z/OS for free

Len
when you get something for free, it&#39;s less valuable than if you pay for it
at the AA, failed
nobody knew what to do with them
harder to do what&#39;s right up front
get a school willing to buy a discounted system
in the IBM AA a school gets a system very inexpensively
then they can have and regulate who uses them

Hiran
good - this limits use cases
may not be able run transactional
learning, devops

Len
could run z/OS under zVM
they could goof it up
just reboot
the other users aren&#39;t affected

Alex
why did the Acadamic Initiative fail?
we&#39;ll have the same challenges
Microsoft did the same thing with Windows
it did not fail
giving it out for free doesn&#39;t mean failure

Kip
we need to be attracting new parties to the mainframe
the highly secure nature of z/OS can be an impediment for open source software
the number of developers will determine the success of the platform
I have two roles
chairman of the GenevaERS project
head of IBM Z consultants
they are being asked to do Java training
doesn&#39;t add to their Z skills
what training do people need on Z?
they need to experiment
that cycle of innovation/experimentation leads to new customers, new parties brought to the environment

Len
if you could get anything you wanted, what would you want?

Kip
I&#39;d like to be able to go to a web page and sign up for my own LPAR for a number of days
I&#39;d like to experiment with packages
ACF2 for a while
install get it to work
reboot
rebuild from scratch
Raspberry Pi
if I were been able to do that on R Pi, G would have been able to get up and going a lot more quickly
we&#39;ve lost momentum

Len
setting up an LPAR is an involved process
however, if you were able to, within an LPAR, IPL a z/OS VM under zVM
is that OK?

Kip
zD&amp;T can give me the same thing

Len
not many users

Kip
but some processes are just me

Len
if word gets out about this, it spreads
Marist manages a LinuxONE cloud
1000-3000 users at any one time

Hiran
why couldn&#39;t we use that for our purposes?

Len
it&#39;s LinuxONE, not z/OS

Kip
I&#39;d like to enable any organization to be able to contribute to this
the most perishable commodity is an unused MIPS
ask if parties would be willing to dedicate some unused MIPS to OSS community
I don&#39;t want to make this specific to any one model
I&#39;d like to open it up

Len
I travel around a lot
I want to know this so that I&#39;m educated in what you&#39;re looking for
I&#39;d like to help in any way I can
stay tuned

Kip
take sample dimensions
rate them on other dimensions
big space
if I have capability on zD&amp;T, we can xxx on other parts of the problem

Sandy
why did it fail?
did they not have sysprog support?
if we can take the pain away from sysprog resources, maybe it could sycceed

Len
factors
when AA was est. in 2003
I retired in 2008
still doing the same thing as IBM, just with a business partner now
we took hardware
just stitting in the wareouse
they needed help because they didn&#39;t have skills
others didn&#39;t do anything with them
only 2-3 out there still
with AA, we gave them a real good discount
they haven&#39;t balked at the price at all
but you still can&#39;t just sell it to them as with commercial clients
still need to provide services and ongoing support
selling a discounted with hours included in the deal
problem we&#39;re facing today
they&#39;re having a harder time getting the funding

Dave
it&#39;s more about the passion
with academic, it&#39;s more transactional
they don&#39;t have a personal motivation

Len
with us, they&#39;ve been very motivated
but there is a lack of skills

Dave
I politely disagree
if people are interested, they will learn
subtle
may be for a grant

Len
doesn&#39;t work that way
been doing it since 2003

Kip
I suggested another meeting for Jan. 21
I could schedule a working session for Jan. 14
anyone who wanted to help with the dimensions

Sandy
are we keeping the meeting notes in Google docs?

John
I could establish a repo now and change the name
I&#39;ll ping you when it&#39;s ready
