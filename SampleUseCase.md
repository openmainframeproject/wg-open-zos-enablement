<h1>Purpose</h1>
The Working Group has decided to use the GenevaERS Demo System as a use case for z/OS access for new users.  This document lists those requirements
<h1>Background</h1>
The OMP GenevaERS Project is in the midst of constructing a Demonstration System that will allow anyone who wants to test drive the tool to do so.  The nature of GenevaERS's system requires access to core z/OS capabilities.  Thus to allow new users to test drive the system, access to z/OS is required.  For many non-mainframe developers, such access is difficult if not impossible.
Using the below requirements, the OzE project will discuss with various parties what it would take for them to make such access possible.  As part of those discussions, OzE team members will document what are the difficult parts of doing so.  This will provide a roadmap for some level of Open Source Development to lower the costs of administration for new users onto the platform by those willing to donate z/OS Resources.
<h1>GenevaERS Demo System Requirements</h1>
The GenevaERS Demo System requires the following:
-This will be provided in the next couple of weeks by the GenevaERS project.
